***1.Functionalities:***

1.1 Parameters:

User should input through GUI parameters like:
                                   Z coordinate Ranges; Membrane Limits; MC Slices; PCA Ranges; Overhang Calculation Ranges;  
                                   axis definition (PCA or MC?)
                                   Axis direction: N->C or Ec->IC1      
                                   Generate Figure yes/no  
1.2 Folder Upload:

User should be able to input folders instead of just files

1.3 Statistics:

User should be able to plot statistics of helices in file/folder

1.4 Results Download:

User should be able to download results: PDBs, PNGs etc. in .zip

1.5 Pymol -> Javascript(GLMOL)

'Figures' should be served in Javascript(GLMOL) instead of Pymol

***2.Good Practices Implementation***

2.1 RawSQL:

Raw SQL should be eliminated/limited

2.2 File/shell operations:

2.3 File/Shell operations should be limited

*** 3.Code Optimization ***

3.1 Storing Intermediate Values in Memory
